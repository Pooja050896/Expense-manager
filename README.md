# Expense-manager
Expense Management System – A web application that allows users to log, categorize, and analyze daily expenses. It provides an intuitive interface for adding and updating entries, along with analytics features such as category-wise breakdowns and trend visualization to help users track spending habits and improve financial planning

This project is a full-featured personal finance tracking tool designed to simplify expense logging and provide actionable insights. The system includes two main modules:
- Add/Update Module: Users can record daily expenses with fields for amount, category, and notes. Interactive controls (increment/decrement buttons, dropdowns, and text inputs) make data entry seamless.
- Analytics Module: Provides category-wise expense breakdowns through visualizations such as bar charts. Users can select custom date ranges to analyze spending patterns, identify high-expense categories, and monitor financial behavior over time.
Key Features:
- Dark mode interface for modern usability.
- Editable expense entries with category dropdowns and notes.
- Date-based filtering for analytics.
- Visual breakdown of expenses by category for quick insights.
Outcome:
The system empowers users to maintain financial discipline by offering both transaction-level detail and aggregate analytics. It supports better budgeting decisions, highlights overspending trends, and serves as a practical portfolio project showcasing skills in UI design, state management, and backend integration.
